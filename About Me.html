        In this series, you'll get to know a little about me and my journey. I
        am currently a student at the University of Technology, Jamaica,
        pursuing a degree in Computer Science. It's been a long road to get
        where I am today, and I still have two more years before completing my
        studies. <br />
        <br />
        When I graduated from high school ten years ago, I was unsure of what
        career path to take. My brother encouraged me to apply to UTECH for
        Midwifery, but I didn’t have the necessary qualifications and wasn’t
        accepted. Determined to move forward, I went back to school to retake
        CXC Mathematics and Human and Social Biology. Even then, I still
        couldn’t decide on a career, so I started applying for various jobs. As
        the years passed, I felt a growing desire to pursue a career, but I
        struggled to find something that truly matched my passion and
        personality. At one point, I applied to Shortwood Teachers College,
        thinking I could follow in my sister’s footsteps and become a teacher.
        While waiting for acceptance, I discovered I was two months pregnant,
        and my life took an unexpected turn. Regret and uncertainty filled my
        mind as everything seemed to spiral out of control. <br />
        <br />
        A year and a half after giving birth, I decided to study Food and
        Beverage at an HEART/TRUST institution. During that year, I realized
        that my true passion wasn’t in the hospitality industry. After
        completing my studies and work experience, I took time to reflect on all
        the jobs I had held and what aspects I enjoyed most. It all became
        clear—while working at a graphics store, I had been fascinated by
        computers, always curious about how they function and how they are
        programmed. With that realization, I reapplied to UTECH, but this time
        for a BSc Degree in Computing, and I’ve been on that path ever since.

        <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
        Sometimes I wonder if this is true <br />
        Maybe there's none, maybe there’s few <br />
        Who is as good and faithful as can be <br />
        Sit back let me tell you a little about me <br />
        <br />I may not be like everyone else <br />
        Because I love being my true self <br />
        In the past, I didn’t know who I am <br />
        I just could not figure out where I belong <br />
        It took me many years to accept my personality <br />
        There, I did not understand much about reality <br />
        I always wish to be rescued <br />
        Rescued from what, I did not know <br />
        Maybe the thoughts of not wanting to live anymore <br />
        My childhood isn’t the most memorable one <br />
        But I thank God where he has brought me from <br />
        The moment I accept Him as Lord <br />
        My whole life started to evolve <br />
        <br />I am not perfect, but yes, I am unique <br />
        Altruistic is a word that describes me <br />
        Caring and loving, that’s who I am <br />
        Getting to know me can be so much fun <br />
        To be happy is my aspiration <br />
        Painting and drawing is my meditation <br />
        And the Kingdom of God is my destination <br />
        There is so much about me I want to say <br />
        But this is where I’ll end it for today <br />
