            I will now provide a summary of the four chapters I have read from the book <i>'Twelve Pillars'</i>
            and explain how the knowledge has influenced me <br><br>
            <h2 style="text-align: center;">"Twelve Pillars"</h2>
            <br><br>
            <b>Chapter 4: "The Fourth Pillar - Wisdom"</b> 
            In this chapter, the authors emphasize the importance of wisdom in personal growth. 
            They suggest that wisdom comes from learning, experience, and the ability to make informed decisions. 
            The chapter underscores the value of continuous learning, seeking guidance from mentors, 
            and applying knowledge in practical ways.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Chapter 5: "The Fifth Pillar - Service"</b> <br>
            Chapter 5 focuses on the concept of service. 
            The authors stress that true success is achieved through serving others and 
            making a positive impact on their lives. 
            They encourage readers to adopt a mindset of giving and contributing to society, 
            both personally and professionally.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Chapter 6: "The Sixth Pillar - Influence"</b> <br>
            In this chapter, the authors discuss the power of influence. 
            They assert that everyone has the capacity to influence others and should use it responsibly. 
            The chapter emphasizes the importance of leading by example and being a positive role model for those around us.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Chapter 7: "The Seventh Pillar - Faith"</b> <br>
            Chapter 7 delves into the significance of faith, not solely in a religious context 
            but also in believing in oneself and one's potential. 
            The authors argue that faith is essential for overcoming challenges and achieving one's goals. 
            They encourage readers to have faith in their abilities and aspirations.
            Overall, these chapters from "Twelve Pillars" promote the idea that success is not solely about personal gain 
            but also about personal development, contributing to others, influencing positively, and having faith in oneself. 
            The book underscores the importance of these pillars as a foundation for achieving a fulfilling and purposeful life. 
            Readers are encouraged to reflect on these principles and apply them to their own journeys toward success and personal growth.
            These chapters collectively reinforce the idea that success is not just about external achievements 
            but also about internal growth and character development. They remind me that personal growth, service to others, 
            positive influence, and faith in oneself are the pillars that support a fulfilling and purposeful life. 
            As I reflect on these principles, I am inspired to apply them in my own journey and strive for not only success 
            but also significance in the lives of others. <br>
