    <h2>My Strongest Trait and Emotion</h2>
    <br>
    <div id="main">
        <div>
            Over the years, I have developed a strong sense of determination. 
            Life has taught me that the key to survival is never giving up, no matter the challenges or hardships that arise.
            This mindset has been the driving force behind my dream of earning a degree, even though I waited ten years after high school to pursue it. 
            I've faced numerous setbacks and discouragement along the way, but I never let go of my belief that one day my dream would be realized. 
            Starting university was just the first step. In my first year, I hit a low point. 
            My son was hospitalized, and I had to miss weeks of school. 
            Tackling programming for the first time while being absent from class set me back significantly. 
            I felt lost, unable to grasp the material, and struggled to catch up. 
            There were moments when I wanted to quit, but my source of strength kept me going. 
            My guiding motto has always been: "There is no life without problems and there is no success without failure."

    <h2>My Hero</h2>
        <div>
            
            While I don’t have a traditional hero, I can say that my hero is Jesus Christ. 
            Reflecting on who I was and who I’ve become, I realize that the encouragement, strength, and motivation that have carried me through tough times come from my faith and the Word of God. 
            Jesus is my hero because, unlike anyone else, He truly understands the pain I’ve hidden behind my smile. 
            No one else can feel or comprehend my struggles the way He can. 
            His presence has been my constant source of strength. 
            Whenever negative thoughts would cloud my mind, His words would remind me: “I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me” (Philippians 4:13). 
            His role as Savior is not limited to spiritual matters—He saves emotionally, mentally, physically, and even financially. 
            I have experienced all of these firsthand. 
            Whenever I called on Him, He answered. 
            He may not always come at the exact moment I call, but He is always on time. 
            Words cannot fully express what He means to me, but I can confidently say that He is the ultimate hero. <br>
